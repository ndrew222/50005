We learned about the overview of OS role in the past week. The kernel is just one part of an operating system. The entire operating system software itself is a much <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>bigger</b></span> one, and it provides various apps and functionalities to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>help users use the computer system</b></span>.

User programs can make <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>system calls</b></span> whenever it needs to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>elevate</b></span> its privileges and run in kernel mode to access the hardware or I/O devices.

In other words, <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>the OS provides services for user programs</b></span>. The goal of making an operating system us to allow users to use the computer system in an easier and more efficient manner.
{:.info}

Below are the brief list of operating system services that are usually provided to the users via the Operating System <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Interface</b></span>: terminal and GUI. We will learn more about each of them this week

### Basic Support

Basic <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>support</b></span> for computer system usage via <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>system call</b></span> routines:

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Program execution</b></span>: The system must be able to load a program into memory and to run that program upon request. The program must be able to end its execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error).
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>I/O Operations</b></span>: Being able to interrupt programs and manage asynchronous I/O requests.
3. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>File-system</b></span> manipulation: programs need to read and write files and directories. They also need to create and delete them by name, search for a given file, and list file information. Finally, some programs include permissions management to allow or deny access to files or directories based on file ownership.
4. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Process communication</b></span>: Processes run in virtual environment. Communications may be implemented via shared memory or through message passing, in which packets of information are moved between processes by the operating system.
   > This include communication protocol via the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>internet</b></span>, where processes in different physical computers can communicate.
5. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Error detection</b></span>: The operating system needs to be constantly aware of possible errors. Errors may occur in the CPU and memory hardware (such as a memory error or a power failure), in I/O devices, etc. For each type of error, the operating system should take the appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing.

### Sharing Resources

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Diagnostics</b></span> report and computer <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>sharing</b></span> feature:

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Resource sharing</b></span>: When there are multiple users or multiple jobs running at the same time, resources must be allocated to each of them. Many different types of resources are managed by the operating system: CPU cycles, main memory, file storage, I/O device routines
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Resource accounting</b></span>: This record keeping may be used for accounting (so that users can be billed) or simply for accumulating usage statistics.

### Network and Security

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Protection</b></span> and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>security</b></span> against external threats:

1. All access to system resources is controlled.
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Defenses</b></span>:
   - To defend against potential threats coming from external I/O devices, including modems and network adapters that may make invalid access attempts
   - To record network traffic and connections for detection of break-ins.

# Operating System User Interface {#operating-system-user-interface}

Users can utilise the OS services in two general ways:

1. Using the Operating system <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>GUI</b></span> or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>CLI</b></span> (<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>User Interface</b></span>)
2. By writing instructions and making system calls within the it (<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Programming Interface</b></span>)

## OS User Interface

The OS User interface gives users <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>convenient</b></span> access to various OS services. They are programs that can execute specialised commands and help users perform appropriate system calls in order to navigate and utilise the computer system.

### GUI {#the-os-gui}

The GUI or desktop environment is what we usually call our <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>home screen</b></span> or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>desktop</b></span>. It characterises the feel and look of an operating system.
{:.info}

We use our mouse and keyboard everyday to interact with the OS GUI and make various system calls, for instance:

1. Opening or closing an app
2. File creation or deletion
3. Get attached device input or output
4. Install new programs, etc

When interacting with the OS through the GUI, users employ a mouse-based <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>window-and-menu</b></span> system characterized by a desktop <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>metaphor</b></span>:

- The user moves the mouse to position its pointer on images, or icons, on the screen (the desktop) that represent programs, files, directories, and system functions.
- Depending on the mouse pointer’s location, clicking a button on the mouse can launch a program,
- Select a file or directory (folder) or pull down a menu that contains commands.

In fact, anything that is performed by the user that involves <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>resource allocation</b></span>, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>memory management</b></span>, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>access to I/O</b></span> and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>hardware</b></span>, and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>system security</b></span> requires <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>system calls</b></span>. Operations to perform various system calls are made easier with the OS interface and more <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>convenient</b></span> with the OS GUI.

Obviously, the GUI is made such that general-purpose computers are user friendly.
{:.info}

You can <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>customise</b></span> your Ubuntu Desktop environment if you wish. By default, it comes with GNOME (3.36, at the time of current writing) desktop, but nothing can stop you from installing [other desktop environments](https://linuxconfig.org/the-8-best-ubuntu-desktop-environments-20-04-focal-fossa-linux).

## CLI {#the-command-line-interface}

The OS CLI (Command Line Interface) is what we usually know as the “terminal” or “command line”.

CLI provides means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>successive</b></span> commands to the program in the form of text. The program which handles this interface feature is called a command-line interpreter. We have experimented with this during Lab 1.
{:.info}

### Command Line Interpreter {#command-line-interpreter}

In `UNIX` systems, the particular program that acts as the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interpreters</b></span> of these commands are known as <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>shells</b></span>[^1]. Users typically interact with a Unix shell via a [terminal emulator](#terminal-emulator), or by <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>directly</b></span> writing a shell script that contains a bunch of successive commands to be executed.

For a system that comes with multiple command line interpreters (shells), a user may choose which one to use. Common shells are the Bourne shell, C-shell, Bourne-Again shell, and Korn shell.

- [Bourne-Again shell](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=shells-bourne-shell) (bash): written as part of the GNU Project to provide a superset of Bourne Shell functionality. This shell can be found installed and is the default interactive shell for users on most Linux distros and macOS systems.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week1/17.png"  class="center_full no-invert"/>

- [Z shell](https://zsh.sourceforge.io) (zsh) is a relatively modern shell that is backward compatible with bash. It's the default shell in macOS since 10.15 Catalina.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week1/18.png"  class="center_full no-invert"/>

- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) – An object-oriented shell developed originally for Windows OS and now available to macOS and Linux.

In short, the shell primarily <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interprets</b></span> a series of commands from the user and executes it. There are two ways to implement commands:

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Built-in</b></span>: the command interpreter itself contains the code to execute the command.
   - For example, a command to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>delete</b></span> a file may cause the command interpreter to jump to a section of its code that sets up the parameters and makes the appropriate system call.
   - In this case, the number of commands that can be given determines the size of the command interpreter, since each command requires its own implementing code.
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>System programs</b></span> (typically found in default `PATH` such at `/usr/bin`): command interpreter does not understand the command in any way; it merely uses the command to identify a file to be loaded into memory and be executed. This is used by UNIX, among other operating systems.
   - You can type `echo $PATH` on your terminal to find out possible places on where these system programs are.

You will be required to implement a `shell`{:.warning} in Programming Assignment 1.
{:.important}

### Terminal Emulator {#terminal-emulator}

A terminal emulator is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>text-based</b></span> user interface (UI) to provide easy access for the users to issue commands. Examples of terminal emulators that we may have encountered before are [iTerm](https://iterm2.com), MacOS terminal, [Termius](https://termius.com), and Windows Terminal.

Almost every system-administrative actions that we can perform on the OS GUI can be done via the CLI. For example, if we want to delete a file in different locations using the OS GUI, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Hover our mouse to click folder after folder until we arrive at a final folder where the target file resides
2. Right click, press delete (or use keyboard shortcut)
3. Repeat until all files are deleted in various paths

Equivalently, we can perform the same action using the CLI. In UNIX systems, we can write the following commands in our terminal emulator:

1. `cd <path>`
2. `rm <filename>`

#### Executing Commands

From Lab 1, you should've had the experience in trying out some simple shell commands. The implementation of the two commands `cd` and `rm` are as follows:

1. The first line is implemented within the shell program itself (<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>changing</b></span> directory with `chdir` system call).
2. The second line will tell the shell to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>search</b></span> for a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>system program</b></span> named <code>rm</code> and execute it with the parameter `<filename>`.
   - <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>System Programs</b></span> are simply programs that come with the OS to help users use the computer. They are run in <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>user</b></span> mode and will help users make the appropriate <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>system calls</b></span> based on the tasks given by the users. More about System Program will be explained in the latter part.
   - The function associated with the `rm` command (removing a file) would be defined completely within the code in the program called <code>rm</code>.
   - In this way, programmers can <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>add</b></span> new commands to the system easily by creating new system programs whose name matches the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>command</b></span>.
   - The command-interpreter program, which can be small, does not have to be changed for new commands to be added.

From Lab 1, you should have been able to find out where your system programs like `ls, mkdir, rm, pwd, ps` reside.

# System Call

Besides using the GUI, we can access OS services using its programming interface (system calls), meaning that we <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>develop</b></span> our own programs that rely on OS services to utilise the computer system’s hardware and I/O devices.

System calls are programming interfaces provided by the OS Kernel for users to access kernel services. Unlike I/O interrupts, system calls are software generated interrupts (trap instruction).
{:.info}

When application programs make system calls, the execution of its original instruction is temporarily suspended and switches to the Kernel mode to execute the system call routine. System calls are one of the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>controlled</b></span> entry points to the kernel (besides interrupts and reset), meaning that we cannot make our program such that our `PC` directly executes arbitrary parts of the kernel space. System calls are the only way for user-mode processes to change into kernel-mode processes via software instructions.

This is usually supported by :

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Hardware</b></span>, e.g.: PC cannot perform `JMP` to code with raw RAM addresses starting with MSB of ‘1’
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Virtualisation</b></span>, user programs operate on virtual memory

System calls are mostly accessed by programs through <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>APIs</b></span> (application program interface), although we can certainly make system calls directly in assembly. There are plenty of examples in the next few sections.

A system call does <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>NOT</b></span> generally require a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>full</b></span> context switch; instead, it is processed in the context of whichever process invoked it.

## Accessing System Calls {#extras-accessing-system-calls}

Take this section with a grain of salt. It is not part of the syllabus but it is handy for you to understand how a regular user process can access kernel code via system calls.
{:.warning}

All processes running in a computer must be able to make system calls. As a result, at the minimum the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>entry</b></span> points into the kernel have to be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>mapped</b></span> into the current address space at all times.

To provide you with a context, let’s see a typical memory layout[^2] of a UNIX process (actual implementation may vary, e.g. Kernel is at low address space instead):
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/1.png"  class="center_full"/>

The virtual address space of a process is typically divided into two parts: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>kernel</b></span> part in the higher address and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>user</b></span> part in the lower address (or vice versa, depending on the Kernel implementation).

The kernel mapping part exists primarily for the<span style="color:#f77729;"><b> kernel-related purposes</b></span>, not user processes. Processes running in user mode don’t have access to the kernel’s address space (with different MSB), at all. In user mode, there is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>single</b></span> mapping for the kernel, shared across all processes, e.g: fixed address between `0xffffffff` to `0xC0000000` as illustrated above.

{: .info}
When a kernel-side page mapping changes, that change is reflected everywhere. Read more about [Kernel Space in the appendix](#kernel-space) if you'd like to find out more. Recall that you have already learned this before as well in 50.002. You can read detailed info such as the **null space** or the **memory mapped region** [in 50.002 notes here](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/virtualmemory#generic-runtime-memory-layout). 


# System Calls via API {#system-calls-through-api}

One of the most common ways to make system calls is through an <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>API</b></span> (Application Programming Interface). We can write a program in a particular language and conveniently perform several system calls through the provided APIs supported by the chosen language as needed.

API is an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interface</b></span> that provides a way to interact with the underlying library[^3] that makes the system calls, often <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>named the same</b></span> as the system calls they invoke.
{:.warning}

An API specifies:

- a set of functions that are available to an application programmer
- the parameters that are passed to each function and
- the return values the programmer can expect

3 most common APIs available:

1. Win32 API for Windows systems written in C++
2. POSIX API for POSIX-based system (all versions of UNIX); mostly written in C. You can find the functions supported by the API [here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
3. Java API for programs running on Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Behind the scenes, the **functions** that make up an API invoke the **actual** system calls on behalf of the application programmer.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/2.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Benefits of using an API to make system calls:

- It adds another layer of **abstraction** hence simplifies the process of application development[^4]
- Supports program **portability**[^5]

Head to this [appendix](#system-call-via-api-examples) section if you'd like to see some examples. 


## Usage and Implementation {#system-call-implementation}

An API helps users make appropriate system calls by providing convenient wrapper functions. More often than not, we don't need to know its detailed implementation as the API already provides convenient <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>abstraction</b></span>.

For most programming languages, the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>run-time support system</b></span> (a set of functions built into libraries included with a compiler) provides a system call <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interface</b></span> that serves as the link to system calls made available by the operating system. The system-call <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interface</b></span> intercepts function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system calls within the operating system. 

The exact implementation differs from system to system, [head to this appendix section](#system-call-detailed-implementation) if you're interested to find out more. 

*Hopefully after understanding this part, you won't say stuffs like this at work:*

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/OS/images/03-os-services/2024-04-24-16-12-25.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

## A simple example in C

Here’s a simple example in C that demonstrates how to use a system call API in C. In this example, we'll use the `write()` system call API in C to write text to the console:

```c
#include <unistd.h>  // For the write() system call
#include <string.h>  // For strlen()

int main() {
    const char *message = "Hello, system call!\n";
    write(1, message, strlen(message));  // 1 is the file descriptor for stdout
    return 0;
}

```


Here’s what’s happening in this example:
- **Header Files**: We include `unistd.h` for the `write()` system call and `string.h` for `strlen()` to calculate the length of the string.
- **Message**: We define a message that we want to write to the console.
- **write() System Call** API: We call `write()` with three arguments:
  - `1` is the file descriptor for standard output (stdout). File descriptor `1` is universally used for stdout in Unix and Linux environments.
  - `message` is the pointer to the buffer containing the string we want to output.
  - `strlen(message)` calculates the length of the string, telling `write()` how many bytes to write.


## Parameter Passing {#system-call-parameter-passing}

System call service <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>routines</b></span> are just like common functions, implemented in the kernel space. They require <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>parameters</b></span> to run. For example, if we request a `write`, one of the most obvious parameters required are the bytes to write.

There are three general ways to pass the parameters required for system calls to the OS Kernel.

### Registers

Pass parameters in <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>registers</b></span>:

- For the example of `write` system call, Kernel examines certain special registers for bytes to print
- Pros: Simple and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>fast</b></span> access
- Cons: There might be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>more</b></span> parameters than registers

### Stack

Push parameters to the program <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>stack</b></span>:

- Pushed to the stack by process running in user mode, then invoke `syscall`
- In kernel mode, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>pops</b></span> the arguments from the calling program’s stack

### Block or Table

Pass parameters that are stored in a persistent contiguous location (<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>table</b></span> or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>block</b></span>) in the RAM (this is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>different</b></span> location from stack!) and pass the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>pointer</b></span> (address) through registers, to be read by the system call routine:

- As illustrated below, `x` represents the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>address</b></span> of the parameters for the system call.
- When system call `id` (e.g: `write`) is made, the kernel examines certain registers, in this example is `rsi` to obtain the address to the parameter (the bytes to write to `stdout`)
- Given the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>pointer</b></span>, Kernel can find the parameter for the system call in the RAM, as illustrated below:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/6.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

# Types of System Calls {#types-of-system-calls}

In general, each OS will provide a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>list</b></span> of system calls that it supports. System calls can be grouped (but not limited to) roughly into six major categories:

1. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Process control</b></span>: end, abort, load, execute, create and terminate processes, get and set process attributes, wait for time, wait for event, signal event, allocate, and free memory
2. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>File manipulation</b></span>: create, delete, rename, open, close, read, write, and reposition files, get, and set file attributes
3. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Device manipulation</b></span>: request and release device, read from, write to, and reposition device, get and set device attributes, logically attach or detach devices
4. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Information maintenance</b></span>: get or set time and date, get or set system data, get or set process, file, or device attributes
5. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Communication</b></span>: create and delete pipes, send or receive packets through network, transfer status information, attach or detach remote devices, etc
6. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Protection</b></span>: set network encryption, protocol

If you are curious about Linux-specific system call types, you can find the list [here](http://asm.sourceforge.net/syscall.html).

# Blocking vs Non-Blocking System Call

A <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>blocking</b></span> system call is one that must <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>wait</b></span> until the action can be completed.

For instance, `read()` is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>blocking</b></span>:

- If no input is ready, the calling process will be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>suspended</b></span>
  - `yield()` the remaining quanta, and schedule other processes first
- It will only resume execution after some input is ready. Depending on the scheduler implementation it may either:
  - Be scheduled again and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>retry</b></span> (e.g: round robin)
    - The process re-executes `read()` and may `yield()` again if there's no input.
    - Repeat until successful.
  - <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Not</b></span> scheduled, use some `wait` flag/status to tell the scheduler to not schedule this again unless some input is received
    - `wait` flag/status cleared by interrupt handler (more info in the next topic)

On the other hand, a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>non blocking</b></span> system call can return almost immediately without waiting for the I/O to complete.

For instance, [`select()`](https://linux.die.net/man/2/select) is non-blocking.

- The `select()` system call can be used to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>check</b></span> if there is new data or not, e.g: at `stdin` file descriptor.
- Then a blocking system call like `read()` may be used afterwards knowing that they will complete immediately.

# Process Control {#process-control}

In this section we choose to explain one particular type of system calls: <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>process control</b></span> with a little bit more depth.

## Process Abort

A running process can either <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>terminate</b></span> <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>normally</b></span> (end) or <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>abruptly</b></span> (abort). In either case, system call to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>abort</b></span> a process is made.

If a system call is made to terminate the currently running program <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>abnormally</b></span>, or if the program runs into a problem and causes an error <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>trap</b></span>, a dump of memory (called [`core dump`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump)) is sometimes taken and an error message generated.

It consists of the recorded state of the program memory at that specific time when the program <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>crashed</b></span>. The dump is written to disk and may be examined by a debugger; a type of system program. It is assumed that the user will issue an appropriate command to respond to any error.

## Process Load and Execute

Loading and executing a new process in the system require system calls. It is possible for a process to call upon the execution of another process, such as creating background processes, etc.

- For instance the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>shell</b></span> creates a new process whenever it receives a new command, and requests to execute that command in the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>new process</b></span> (next chapter)

## Process Communication

Having created new jobs or processes, we may need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>wait</b></span> for them to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>finish</b></span> their execution, e.g: the shell only gives the next prompt after the previous command has completed its execution.

- We may want to wait for a certain amount of time to pass `(wait time)`; more probably, we will want to wait for a specific event to occur` (wait event)`.
- The jobs or processes should then signal when that event has occurred `(signal event)`.
- Also, sometimes two or more processes <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>share</b></span> data and multiple processes need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>communicate</b></span> (e.g: a web server communicating with the database server).
- All these features to `wait, signal event`, and other means of process <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>communication</b></span> are done by making system calls since each process is run in <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>isolation</b></span> by default, operating on <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>virtual addresses</b></span>.

## Examples

There are so many facets of and variations in process and job control that we need to clarify using examples: MS-DOS and FreeBSD.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/7.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

### Single-tasking System

An example of a single-tasking system is MS-DOS, shown in the figure on the left.

It has a simple command <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interpreter</b></span> (that is invoked when the computer is started as shown in the figure above, labeled as `(a)`). Upon opening a new program, it <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>loads</b></span> the program into memory, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>writing over most of itself</b></span> (note the shrinking portion of command interpreter codebase) to give the program<span style="color:#f77729;"><b> as much memory as possible </b></span>as shown in `(b)` above.

Next, it sets the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>instruction pointer</b></span> to the first instruction of the program.

- The program then runs, and either an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>error</b></span> causes a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>trap</b></span>, or the program executes a system call to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>terminate</b></span>.
- In either case, the error code is saved in the system memory for later use.

Following this action, the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>small</b></span> portion of the command interpreter that was not overwritten resumes execution:

- Its first task is to reload the rest of the command interpreter from disk.
- Then the command interpreter makes the previous error code available to the user or to the next program.
- It stands by for more input command from the user.

### Multi-tasking system

An example of a multi-tasking system is FreeBSD. The FreeBSD operating system is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>multi-tasking</b></span> OS that is able to create and manage multiple processes at a time.

When a user logs on to the system, the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>shell</b></span> (command interpreter) of the user’s choice is run. This shell is similar to the MS-DOS shell in that it accepts commands and executes programs that the user requests.

However, since FreeBSD is a multitasking system, the command interpreter may <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>continue running</b></span> while another program is executed:

- The possible state of a RAM with FreeBSD OS is as shown in the figure above
- To <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>start</b></span> a new process, the shell executes a `fork()` system call.
- Then, the selected program is loaded into memory via an `exec()`[^9] system call, and the program is executed normally until it executes `exit() `system call to end normally or `abort` system call.

Depending on the way the command was issued, the shell then either <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>waits</b></span> for the process to finish or runs the process “in the background”. In the latter case, the shell immediately requests another command.

The kernel is responsible to ensure that <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>context switching</b></span> is properly done (and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>timesharing</b></span> as well if enabled).

To run a command in the background, add the ampersand symbol (`&`) at the end of the command:

```bash
command &
```

# Summary
This chapter offers an in-depth examination of the services provided by operating systems to facilitate user interactions and efficient system management. It explores various aspects of system calls and user interfaces, detailing how these elements work together to enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of computing systems.

Key learning points include:
- **System Calls and API**: Discusses how system calls serve as interfaces for programs to request services from the OS kernel, including process control, file manipulation, and device management.
- **User Interfaces**: Explores the roles of graphical (GUI) and command-line interfaces (CLI) in providing access to system services, emphasizing the ease of use and functionality they offer to users.
- **Process and Resource Management**: Detailed explanation of how operating systems handle processes, manage resources, and ensure security through careful control and monitoring.


In summary, operating systems provide <span class="orange-bold">essential</span> **services** that enhance user interaction and system efficiency through various interfaces and functionalities. They manage resource allocation, execute programs, facilitate I/O operations, and maintain file systems. Additionally, OS services include **process communication** and error detection to ensure stable and secure operations. The OS interfaces, such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI), enable users to interact with these services effectively.

## System Call via API Examples
### Example: printf()

We always conveniently call `printf()` whenever we want to display our output to the console in C. `printf` itself is a POSIX system call <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>API</b></span>.

- This function requires kernel service as it involves access to hardware: output display.
- The function `printf` is actually making several other function calls to prepare the resources or requirements for this system call **and** finally make the actual system call that invokes the kernel’s help to display the output to the display.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/3.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

The full implementation of `printf` in Mach OS can be found [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-201/osfmk/kern/printf.c.auto.html). It calls other functions like `putc` and eventually `write` function that makes the system call to `stdout` file descriptor.

### Example: CopyFile()

We also always conveniently copy one file into another location (be it programmatically or through the GUI). In Windows OS, this is supported by the `CopyFile`[^7] function (Win32 API):

```
CopyFile(szFilePath.c_str(), szCopyPath.c_str(), FALSE );
```

The complete documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-copyfile). The instruction sequence that is made by this `CopyFile` function to complete the entire copy operation is actually pretty lengthy, involving **multiple** system calls. In `CopyFile` case alone, multiple system calls are made for writing to file, opening files, obtaining file name, reading from file, termination, etc (image below taken from SGG book)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/4.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

The actual implementation details (source code) of OS functions like `CopyFile` are intentionally not documented and can be changed at any time. The API however is well documented and conformed to so others who rely on it will not have their programs broken due to internal OS updates.

## System Call Detailed Implementation 

System calls are interfaces through which user applications interact with the operating system's kernel to perform tasks that require higher privileges, such as I/O operations, process management, and file manipulations. Here’s a high-level overview of their implementation and the role of system call numbers:

- **System Call Implementation**: System calls are implemented as part of the operating system kernel. When a user program invokes a system call, it executes a software interrupt or a special instruction that switches the processor from user mode to kernel mode. This transition is necessary because system calls often require accessing resources that are protected and can only be safely manipulated by the kernel.

- **System Call Number**: Each system call is associated with a unique identifier known as a system call number. This number is used to index into a system call table maintained by the kernel, which maps numbers to the corresponding system call handlers. When a system call is invoked, the kernel uses this number to find the appropriate function to execute.

The system call mechanism is a critical component of the operating system, allowing for safe and controlled interaction between user applications and hardware or kernel functions.

### System Call Number

Typically, a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>number</b></span> is associated with each system call, and the system-call interface maintains a table indexed according to these numbers. For example, Linux system call tables and its associated numbers can be found [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl) and FreeBSD Kernel System call table can be found [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.3.12/bsd/kern/syscalls.master).

To further understand the points above, let's see a sample assembly file to print `Hello World` to console.

#### Hello World in Assembly (Linux, x86-64)

```armasm
; hello_world.s
global _start

section .text

_start:
  mov rax, 1        ; system call number for write
  mov rdi, 1        ;    making file handle stdout
  mov rsi, msg      ;   passing adress of string to output
  mov rdx, msglen   ;   number of bytes
  syscall           ; invoking os to write

  mov rax, 60       ; sys call number for exit
  mov rdi, 0        ;   exit code 0 EXIT_SUCCESS
  syscall           ; invoke os to exit

section .rodata
  msg: db "Hello, world!", 10
  msglen: equ $ - msg
```

Compilation and execution:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o hello_world.o hello_world.s
ld -o hello_world hello_world.
./hello_world
```

#### Hello World in Assembly (macOS X, x86-64)

```armasm
; hello_world.s
global _main
section .text
_main:
  mov rax, 0x2000004 ; system call number for write
  mov rdi, 1 ; file descriptor 1 is stdout
  mov rsi, msg ; get string address
  mov rdx, msg.len ; number of bytes
  syscall ; exec syscall write
  mov rax, 0x2000001 ; syscall number for exit
  mov rdi, 0 ; exit code 0
  syscall ; exit program
section .data
msg:    db      "Hello, world!", 10
.len:   equ     $ - msg
```

Compilation and execution:

```bash
nasm -f macho64 hello_world.s
ld -lSystem -o hello_world hello_world.o
./hello_world
```

#### Hello World in Assembly (macOS X, M1)

```armasm
// hello_world.s
.global _start             // Provide program starting address to linker
.align 2

// Setup the parameters to print hello world
// and then call Linux to do it.
_start: mov X0, #1     // 1 = StdOut
        adr X1, helloworld // string to print
        mov X2, #13     // length of our string
        mov X16, #4     // MacOS write system call
        svc 0     // Call linux to output the string

// Setup the parameters to exit the program
// and then call Linux to do it.

        mov     X0, #0      // Use 0 return code
        mov     X16, #1     // Service command code 1 terminates this program
        svc     0           // Call MacOS to terminate the program

helloworld:      .ascii  "hello, world!\n"
```

Compilation and execution:

```bash
as -g -o hello_world.o hello_world.s
ld -macosx_version_min 12.0.0 -o hello_world hello_world.o -lSystem -syslibroot `xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` -e _start -arch arm64
./hello_world
```

From the three examples above, it is obvious that system call numbers are <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>hardware dependent</b></span>. Note that the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>registers used</b></span> are also machine specific. In x86-64 architecture, `rax` stands for the register to pass the system call id, `rdi` stands the register that should contain file descriptor (1 for `stdout` in your terminal), etc. In M1 architecture, the equivalent to `rax` is `X16`, and `rdi` is `X0`.

#### Hello World in C

In contrast, here's an implementation in C, short and sweet.

```c
// hello_world.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

Compilation and execution:

```bash
gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c
./hello_world
```

Here's the implementation in Python. Even shorter and sweeter:

```python
# hello_world.py
print('Hello, world!')
```

Execution: `python hello_world.py`

The **same** C program can be compiled for either OS, and so is the python program. The C system call <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interface</b></span> then invokes the intended system call in the operating-system kernel by <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>trapping</b></span> itself and invoking the trap handler (runs in kernel mode from now onwards):

1. The trap handler first <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>saves</b></span> the states of the process[^8] and examines the system call index left in a certain register.
2. It then refers to the standard system call table and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>dispatches</b></span> the system service request accordingly, i.e: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>branches</b></span> onto the address in the Kernel space that implements the system call service routine of the system call with that index and executes it.

When the system call service routine <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>returns</b></span> to the trap handler, the program execution can be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>resumed</b></span>. If the system call does not return yet (e.g: block system call like `input()`), then the scheduler may be called to schedule another process, while this process is put to wait until the requested service is available.

The relationship between application program, API, System call interface, and the kernel is shown below (_image screenshot from SGG book)_:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week2/5.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Notice that `printf` is just a C function that will eventually calls the `write` C function, and will eventually invoke the `write` systemcall. We can also do the same thing by using `write` C function:

```c
// hello_world.c
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    // write(fd, char*, #bytes)
    write(1, "hello, world!\n", 14);
    return 0;
}
```

For obvious reasons, `printf` is more convenient because we don’t have to care about arguments like “1” (file descriptor for stout) and “14” (bytes in the printed string) and having to read the manual page for your hardware to find out what these mean inside `write`.

`write` is actually a convenient and more human-friendly <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>wrapper</b></span> around the another C function: `syscall`. It utilises the symbol `SYS_write` to indicate the system call number which value varies depending on the OS.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

int main()
{
    // write(fd, char*, #bytes)
    syscall(SYS_write, 1, "hello, world!\n", 14);
    return 0;
}
```

Many wrappers in APIs are named after the system call itself, just like `write` or `syscall` that’s meant to invoke the actual WRITE system call and invoke the `syscall` routine.
In summary, making system calls <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>directly</b></span> in the application code is possible, but more complicated and may require embedded assembly code to be used (in C and C++) as well as knowledge of the low-level binary interface for the system call operation, which may be subject to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>change</b></span> over time and thus not be part of the application binary interface; <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>the API is meant to abstract this away</b></span>.
{:.warning}

You can find out more about Linux[^6] system calls <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>API</b></span> (implemented in C) [here](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html)


## Kernel Space

The kernel is divided into two spaces: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>logical</b></span> and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>virtual</b></span>, often called `lowmem` and `vmalloc` respectively.

In `lowmem`, it often uses a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>one-to-one</b></span> mapping between virtual and physical addresses (its called logical mapping). That means virtual address `X` is mapped to physical address `X+C` (where `C` is some constant if any). This mapping is built during <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>boot</b></span>, and is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>never</b></span> changed.

The kernel virtual address area (`vmalloc`) is used for <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>non-contiguous</b></span> physical memory location, so that it is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>easier</b></span> to allocate them.

- This allocation of process memory is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>dynamic</b></span> and on demand.
- On each allocation, a series of locations of physical pages are found for the corresponding kernel virtual address range, and the pagetable is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>modified</b></span> to create the mapping.
- If this is done, it might be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unsuitable</b></span> for DMA (Direct Memory Access).
